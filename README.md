# weather-dashboard-06

Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

A weather dashboard was created with HTML, Server-side APIs, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, and Dayjs libraries to retrieve and display data.

A great way to get the weather outlook for different cities in case the user wishes to plan a trip.


Installation

To install the project, I've initiated my local working folder into a GitHub Repository, then pushed the local files to the Repository after adding and commiting the updated codes.

To access the project, please enter the Live Page URL found below.


Usage

The user will be given an input form on the landing page to type in the city in which they wish to see a 5-day forecast of.

Once the magnifying button has been clicked, the user will be displayed the CURRENT weather, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index.

Below that information, the user will be given the forecast for the next 5 days (including current day).

The city will be saved into the users Local Storage and can be clicked upon in the future to check the weather.
